# Text-to-speech (TTS)
Advance Data Structures
# Text-to-Speech Converter

This simple Python script demonstrates how to use the `gTTS` library to convert text to speech and play it back. It uses Google's Text-to-Speech API to generate audio files from text input.

## Installation

You can install the necessary library using pip:
pip install gTTS



## Usage

1. Replace the sample text with the text you want to convert to audio in the script.
2. Run the script.
3. The generated audio file will be saved as `prueba.mp3` in the same directory.
4. The audio will be played back automatically.

##Note

Make sure you have an internet connection while running the script as it requires access to Google's Text-to-Speech API.
